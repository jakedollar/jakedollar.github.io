  <!-- Main Content -->
  <main>
    <p>The web is today’s Main Street because it brings people and businesses together in a dynamic, accessible way, much like the downtowns of the past. In earlier generations, local Main Streets were places where neighbors gathered, businesses displayed their best offerings, and relationships were built face-to-face with one another. Now, the internet fulfills this role by allowing businesses to showcase products and services to a wider audience while remaining connected with customers through websites and social media. It is a place where small businesses like Jake's Golf Shop can share stories with customers, announce events, and provide value beyond just a physical storefront. The web enables communities to thrive, knowledge to be shared instantly, and customers to find what they need with ease, making it a digital marketplace that never closes, we are always here to help.</p>
